## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Huong, a Computer Science student at the University of Information Technology, Ho Chi Minh City (2024). Passionate about developing web applications, Iâ€™m currently exploring **Blazor** and **EF Core** to build dynamic web solutions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a member management web app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about **async Task methods** in Blazor.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source .NET projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to **web development** or **SQL Server**.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can reboot a server to speed up performance in seconds!

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with other tech enthusiasts!
